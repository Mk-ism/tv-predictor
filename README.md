An Android TV app that shows the Show preferences according to the person watching the television. 

### Problem

When we start the TV we are either shown a random channel or the homepage, and then we have to navigate to all the way to our favourite show.

### Solution
When the app is activated, the camera would capture the image of the person sitting in front of the STB and show the Show preferences accordingly.
